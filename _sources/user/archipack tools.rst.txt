Archipack Tools

   AutoBoolean

Apply holes
"""""""""""

When exporting or in order to clean up your scene, you might want to apply booleans and cleanup holes objects.

.. note::
	With regular archipack wall you are able to undo this operation at any time by selecting the wall and use AutoBoolean 

.. warning::
	With 2d to 3d walls there is no undo for this operation, so use with care !


Make objects safe to edit
-------------------------

Archipack objects are regular blender mesh so you may edit them at any time.
However, modifying any parameter after edit will regenerate mesh and you'll then loose your changes.

   Kill parameters

In order to prevent any parameter edit and get a "safe to edit by hand" non archipack aware mesh, use either "selected" or "all" found in Archipack Tools -> Kill parameters.

.. warning::
	There is no undo for this operation, so use with care !
